# Changelog

All notable changes to **cc-statusbar** are documented here.
Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [1.0.17] — 2026-06-16

> **Heads-up: your token numbers will look lower after this update — that is the
> fix, not a regression.** Your actual usage did not change. Earlier versions
> were over-counting, so the bar was showing inflated figures. It now shows the
> real numbers.

### Fixed

- **Token counts were inflated ~2.3–3.3×.** Claude Code writes a single model
  reply to its log as several lines (one per part of the answer — reasoning,
  text, each tool call) and repeats the same usage figures on every line. The
  extension was adding those up per line, so one reply was counted 2–4 times.
  This inflated every absolute number: work tokens, cache read/write,
  token-equivalent, and the "N× cheaper" savings. We now count each reply once
  (deduplicated by its response id). The numbers will drop to their true values.

  Unaffected and unchanged: cache hit-rate (%), context-window fill (%), cache
  tier (1h/5m), and the 5h/7d quota bars — those were already correct.

## [1.0.16] — 2026-06-08

### Added

- **Codex provider support.** The status bar can now show Codex 5h/7d quota,
  context, cached-input usage, and token-equivalent details from the local Codex
  app-server and Codex session history.
- **Provider and language controls in the hover.** Switch between `Auto`,
  `Claude Code`, and `Codex`, plus `Auto` / `RU` / `EN`, without opening VS Code
  Settings.
- **Codex panel view.** Codex uses the same information layout as Claude Code:
  token-equivalent, quota, context, cache, and details. Metrics Codex does not
  expose, such as cache tier and cache write, are shown as unavailable instead of
  guessed.

### Changed

- Renamed the extension display name to **Claude/Codex Usage — Quota & Context
  Statusbar** while keeping the same extension ID (`solux-dev.cc-statusbar`).
- Renamed the cache headline for both Claude Code and Codex to
  **token-equivalent**. Raw token counters are real local data; cache savings use
  the extension's configured cache weights and are not presented as billing.
- Hid technical Codex app-server/socket diagnostics from the user-facing
  hover/panel. Diagnostics are logged to the VS Code output channel and extension
  log instead.

### Fixed

- Codex context and cache now read from local Codex `token_count` history when
  available, so long-running Codex sessions show context/cache after a response
  instead of staying at `n/a`.
- Added regression coverage for workspace paths with spaces, dashes, underscores,
  and dots.

## [1.0.4] — 2026-06-02

### Fixed

- **The status bar now appears for projects whose folder name contains a space**
  (or any non-alphanumeric character — dots, parentheses, etc.). The extension
  locates a project's Claude Code session by reconstructing Claude Code's project
  slug from the workspace path, but the slug builder only collapsed `: \ / _` to
  `-` and **left spaces intact** — so for a folder like `Kasta Rico` it looked in
  `…-Kasta Rico` while Claude Code had written the session to `…-Kasta-Rico`. The
  transcript was never found, so the bar showed only an empty fallback and looked
  broken. The slug now collapses **every** non-alphanumeric character to `-`,
  exactly matching Claude Code's own slug. Folders without such characters are
  unaffected. This hit any path with a space — common on Windows
  (`C:\Users\First Last\…`). Added a regression test.

## [1.0.3] — 2026-06-01

### Fixed

- **Quota & context now survive slow, high-latency links** (VPN tunnels,
  remote/cloud-hosted Claude Code, users on the move). The quota and
  context-window requests used a single attempt with undici's ~10s connect
  timeout, so a route to `api.anthropic.com` that answered in, say, 8–15s would
  intermittently time out — making the **5h / 7d tariff blink in and out** while
  the main agent (which tolerates the latency) kept working. Both requests now
  use a **resilient transport**: a few sequential attempts with **escalating
  per-attempt timeouts** (6s → 14s → 22s) so a healthy link still returns fast
  while a slow link succeeds on a later, more patient attempt. The transport
  **adapts** — it remembers the last successful round-trip and pre-sizes the next
  poll's timeouts to the user's real link speed, so a consistently slow channel
  stops failing its early attempts. Only transient failures (timeouts, `5xx`,
  `429`-aside) are retried; auth errors are not. Worst case is bounded (~42s) and
  still costs at most ~1 token per (already throttled) poll.

### Notes

- This covers **tunnel** VPNs (WireGuard/AmneziaWG/OpenVPN) and direct/no-VPN
  setups, which already routed correctly at the OS layer — the fix adds patience
  for their latency. **Proxy-mode** VPNs (a local SOCKS/HTTP proxy) are a separate
  axis: Node's `fetch` does not honour proxy settings, so that case still needs
  explicit proxy support (tracked separately, as it implies a dependency).

## [1.0.2] — 2026-06-01

Docs/release-plumbing only — no extension code changes.

### Changed

- **Refreshed the README screenshots** to the current v1.0.x UI (cache-tier line,
  informational context dot, quota + context). Cache-busted the image URLs so
  GitHub's image proxy serves the new ones.
- First release published through the **automated pipeline** (tag push → tests →
  Open VSX + GitHub Release).
- Added a `.mailmap` so all authorship shows under the single `Solux-dev`
  identity.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-05-31

### Fixed

- **Panel hover footnotes now follow the editor theme.** They used the OS-native
  `title` tooltip, which renders on a light background regardless of theme and
  was hard to read in dark mode. Replaced with a themeable CSS tooltip using VS
  Code's hover-widget colours, so it's dark in dark themes and light in light
  themes.

### Changed

- **Context-limit failures are now diagnosable.** When the context-window limit
  can't be fetched, the tooltip shows the reason (e.g. `limit n/a — http 403`),
  and a failed lookup is retried within ~a minute instead of 10 — so a transient
  first-fetch glitch (common right after install) self-heals quickly.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-31

First stable release. The extension now sells exactly what a Claude Code
subscriber can't get conveniently elsewhere — **5h / 7d quota** and **context
window %** — with cache as a quiet, honest extra.

### Added

- **Cache insight (panel + tooltip).** The session's prompt-cache **tier
  (`1-hour` / `5-minute`) is auto-detected** from the transcript's per-turn
  `cache_creation.ephemeral_{1h,5m}` fields — read from the data, never a
  hardcoded TTL assumption, so it stays correct as Anthropic adjusts caching.
  A concise self-explanatory line shows in the hover tooltip; the panel adds a
  **Cache** section with the tier and a descriptive **input-from-cache %**, each
  with a hover footnote (ⓘ) explaining what it means and how to use it.

### Changed

- **Renamed** to *“Claude Code Usage — Quota & Context Statusbar”* with a
  quota/context-first description (the install URL `solux-dev.cc-statusbar` is
  unchanged). “Cost” is demoted to a quiet extra — for a subscriber, cost means
  quota consumption, not token accounting.
- **Context dot is now purely informational** — 🟢 under 50% · 🟡 50–80% ·
  🔴 80%+, always shown, and it **never** recolours the whole status-bar item
  (the whole-item fill stays reserved for the quota pace). Context is a "room for
  the next step" read, not a quota with consequences.

### Fixed

- **Robust cache-token parsing.** Falls back to the nested
  `cache_creation.ephemeral_{5m,1h}` breakdown when the top-level
  `cache_creation_input_tokens` reports 0 (a Claude Code <v2.1.152 quirk).
- **Subagent turns (`isSidechain`) are excluded** from the main session's
  context and cache stats — they have their own window and 5-minute tier and
  would otherwise confound the numbers.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-31

### Added

- **Context-window usage %.** Shows how full the model's context window is right
  now — current input ÷ the model's `max_input_tokens` — so you can tell how big
  a next task can be. This is different from the cost metric (which only grows).
  Appears in the collapsed status bar (`· ctx 47%` / `· конт 47%`, after the
  tariff segments) and as a full `context: 47% (468k / 1M)` line in the tooltip
  and panel. Coloured by fill (≥85% yellow, ≥95% red) — a **fixed threshold**,
  deliberately not the time-based tariff pace.
- The window limit is read once per model from the Anthropic **Models API**
  (`max_input_tokens`), using the same local OAuth token as the quota feature,
  cached 24h. **No hardcoded model→window table** — if the limit can't be
  fetched the % is hidden (never guessed), and a fix is an isolated update.
- Setting `ccStatusbar.context.enabled` (default `true`) to turn the lookup off.

### Changed

- **Panel/tooltip lead with the cost answer.** The breakdown now opens with
  *cost (with cache) · without cache · ~N× cheaper* and demotes the raw
  work/cache numbers to a muted **Details** block — so the value of caching is
  obvious without mental math.
- Token figures drop a trailing `.0` (`1M` not `1.0M`, `468k` not `468.0k`).

## [0.3.1] — 2026-05-31

### Changed

- **Clearer cache savings.** Instead of an abstract “saved vs no-cache” line,
  the tooltip and panel now show the two totals side by side — *without caching
  ≈ X* vs *with caching (effective) ≈ Y → saved ≈ Z* — so the benefit of caching
  is obvious at a glance (RU: «без кэша было бы… / с кэшем…»).
- Removed the unimplemented “pace” line that was documented but never shown
  (the extension does not measure active work time).

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-30

### Added

- **Persistent usage panel.** A “⤢ Open panel” link in the tooltip (and a
  *“Open usage panel”* command) opens a dockable, **live-updating** panel with
  the full breakdown — so you can keep it open and study it, instead of relying
  on the auto-hiding hover tooltip. Clicking the status-bar item still refreshes.

## [0.2.2] — 2026-05-30

### Added

- **Easy language switching:** a “🌐 Change language / Сменить язык” link at the
  bottom of the hover tooltip, and a **“Claude Code Statusbar: Switch language”**
  command — so the language is discoverable without digging into Settings.

### Changed

- Reworded the pace verdicts for clarity and made the per-window verdict match
  the legend. EN: `on track` / `running tight` / `over pace`. RU: `в норме` /
  `близко к лимиту` / `выше нормы`.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-05-30

### Added

- Extension icon (coral tile with a usage-gauge and a green "on-track" dot).
- Screenshots (English + Russian tooltip) in the README.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-30

### Added

- **English + Russian localization** of the whole runtime UI (status bar +
  hover tooltip). New setting `ccStatusbar.language`: `auto` (follow the
  editor's display language, default), `en`, or `ru`. Command titles localized
  via `package.nls`.
- **Glossary** ("what you see", EN + RU) in the README, plus plainer
  pace-verdict wording (`on track` / `cutting it close` / `spending faster than
  the limit`; RU `в норме` / `впритык` / `опережение`).

### Changed

- README is now English-first; the Reliability section is in English.
- `fmtRemaining` and `paceLevel` take language into account (pure functions;
  unit-tested in both languages).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-30

Initial release.

### Added

- Status-bar item with a **tariff-only collapsed view**: per-window colored dot
  (🟢 в норме / 🟡 впритык / 🔴 опережение) + `5ч` / `7д` usage % + time-to-reset.
- **Real 5h / 7d subscription quota** (Claude.ai Pro/Max/Team) via Anthropic
  rate-limit response headers, throttled (≤ once per `quota.minPollSeconds`,
  default 300s) and activity-gated; can be disabled.
- **Hover tooltip** with the analytical breakdown:
  `работа (вход+выход)` + `на кэш (в эфф.)` = `эффективно`, plus cache
  read/write and estimated savings.
- `effective = work + 0.1·cache_read + 1.25·cache_write` — cache-weighted
  comparable consumption, computed from the local session transcript
  (+ subagents), matching the project's `session-cost.py`.
- Whole-item background turns yellow/red when the burn pace risks exceeding a
  window.
- Settings under `ccStatusbar.*` (refresh interval, weights, quota toggle,
  poll throttle, credentials path, alignment).
- Graceful degradation: if the quota channel fails, local metrics keep working
  and only the tariff line is hidden.

### Notes

- The 5h/7d quota uses an undocumented Anthropic channel — see README
  "Reliability". Local token/effective/cache metrics are unaffected by such
  changes.
