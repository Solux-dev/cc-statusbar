# Changelog

All notable changes to **cc-statusbar** are documented here.
Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [1.0.4] — 2026-06-02

### Fixed

- **The status bar now appears for projects whose folder name contains a space**
  (or any non-alphanumeric character — dots, parentheses, etc.). The extension
  locates a project's Claude Code session by reconstructing Claude Code's project
  slug from the workspace path, but the slug builder only collapsed `: \ / _` to
  `-` and **left spaces intact** — so for a folder like `Kasta Rico` it looked in
  `…-Kasta Rico` while Claude Code had written the session to `…-Kasta-Rico`. The
  transcript was never found, so the bar showed only an empty fallback and looked
  broken. The slug now collapses **every** non-alphanumeric character to `-`,
  exactly matching Claude Code's own slug. Folders without such characters are
  unaffected. This hit any path with a space — common on Windows
  (`C:\Users\First Last\…`). Added a regression test.

## [1.0.3] — 2026-06-01

### Fixed

- **Quota & context now survive slow, high-latency links** (VPN tunnels,
  remote/cloud-hosted Claude Code, users on the move). The quota and
  context-window requests used a single attempt with undici's ~10s connect
  timeout, so a route to `api.anthropic.com` that answered in, say, 8–15s would
  intermittently time out — making the **5h / 7d tariff blink in and out** while
  the main agent (which tolerates the latency) kept working. Both requests now
  use a **resilient transport**: a few sequential attempts with **escalating
  per-attempt timeouts** (6s → 14s → 22s) so a healthy link still returns fast
  while a slow link succeeds on a later, more patient attempt. The transport
  **adapts** — it remembers the last successful round-trip and pre-sizes the next
  poll's timeouts to the user's real link speed, so a consistently slow channel
  stops failing its early attempts. Only transient failures (timeouts, `5xx`,
  `429`-aside) are retried; auth errors are not. Worst case is bounded (~42s) and
  still costs at most ~1 token per (already throttled) poll.

### Notes

- This covers **tunnel** VPNs (WireGuard/AmneziaWG/OpenVPN) and direct/no-VPN
  setups, which already routed correctly at the OS layer — the fix adds patience
  for their latency. **Proxy-mode** VPNs (a local SOCKS/HTTP proxy) are a separate
  axis: Node's `fetch` does not honour proxy settings, so that case still needs
  explicit proxy support (tracked separately, as it implies a dependency).

## [1.0.2] — 2026-06-01

Docs/release-plumbing only — no extension code changes.

### Changed

- **Refreshed the README screenshots** to the current v1.0.x UI (cache-tier line,
  informational context dot, quota + context). Cache-busted the image URLs so
  GitHub's image proxy serves the new ones.
- First release published through the **automated pipeline** (tag push → tests →
  Open VSX + GitHub Release).
- Added a `.mailmap` so all authorship shows under the single `Solux-dev`
  identity.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-05-31

### Fixed

- **Panel hover footnotes now follow the editor theme.** They used the OS-native
  `title` tooltip, which renders on a light background regardless of theme and
  was hard to read in dark mode. Replaced with a themeable CSS tooltip using VS
  Code's hover-widget colours, so it's dark in dark themes and light in light
  themes.

### Changed

- **Context-limit failures are now diagnosable.** When the context-window limit
  can't be fetched, the tooltip shows the reason (e.g. `limit n/a — http 403`),
  and a failed lookup is retried within ~a minute instead of 10 — so a transient
  first-fetch glitch (common right after install) self-heals quickly.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-31

First stable release. The extension now sells exactly what a Claude Code
subscriber can't get conveniently elsewhere — **5h / 7d quota** and **context
window %** — with cache as a quiet, honest extra.

### Added

- **Cache insight (panel + tooltip).** The session's prompt-cache **tier
  (`1-hour` / `5-minute`) is auto-detected** from the transcript's per-turn
  `cache_creation.ephemeral_{1h,5m}` fields — read from the data, never a
  hardcoded TTL assumption, so it stays correct as Anthropic adjusts caching.
  A concise self-explanatory line shows in the hover tooltip; the panel adds a
  **Cache** section with the tier and a descriptive **input-from-cache %**, each
  with a hover footnote (ⓘ) explaining what it means and how to use it.

### Changed

- **Renamed** to *“Claude Code Usage — Quota & Context Statusbar”* with a
  quota/context-first description (the install URL `solux-dev.cc-statusbar` is
  unchanged). “Cost” is demoted to a quiet extra — for a subscriber, cost means
  quota consumption, not token accounting.
- **Context dot is now purely informational** — 🟢 under 50% · 🟡 50–80% ·
  🔴 80%+, always shown, and it **never** recolours the whole status-bar item
  (the whole-item fill stays reserved for the quota pace). Context is a "room for
  the next step" read, not a quota with consequences.

### Fixed

- **Robust cache-token parsing.** Falls back to the nested
  `cache_creation.ephemeral_{5m,1h}` breakdown when the top-level
  `cache_creation_input_tokens` reports 0 (a Claude Code <v2.1.152 quirk).
- **Subagent turns (`isSidechain`) are excluded** from the main session's
  context and cache stats — they have their own window and 5-minute tier and
  would otherwise confound the numbers.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-31

### Added

- **Context-window usage %.** Shows how full the model's context window is right
  now — current input ÷ the model's `max_input_tokens` — so you can tell how big
  a next task can be. This is different from the cost metric (which only grows).
  Appears in the collapsed status bar (`· ctx 47%` / `· конт 47%`, after the
  tariff segments) and as a full `context: 47% (468k / 1M)` line in the tooltip
  and panel. Coloured by fill (≥85% yellow, ≥95% red) — a **fixed threshold**,
  deliberately not the time-based tariff pace.
- The window limit is read once per model from the Anthropic **Models API**
  (`max_input_tokens`), using the same local OAuth token as the quota feature,
  cached 24h. **No hardcoded model→window table** — if the limit can't be
  fetched the % is hidden (never guessed), and a fix is an isolated update.
- Setting `ccStatusbar.context.enabled` (default `true`) to turn the lookup off.

### Changed

- **Panel/tooltip lead with the cost answer.** The breakdown now opens with
  *cost (with cache) · without cache · ~N× cheaper* and demotes the raw
  work/cache numbers to a muted **Details** block — so the value of caching is
  obvious without mental math.
- Token figures drop a trailing `.0` (`1M` not `1.0M`, `468k` not `468.0k`).

## [0.3.1] — 2026-05-31

### Changed

- **Clearer cache savings.** Instead of an abstract “saved vs no-cache” line,
  the tooltip and panel now show the two totals side by side — *without caching
  ≈ X* vs *with caching (effective) ≈ Y → saved ≈ Z* — so the benefit of caching
  is obvious at a glance (RU: «без кэша было бы… / с кэшем…»).
- Removed the unimplemented “pace” line that was documented but never shown
  (the extension does not measure active work time).

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-30

### Added

- **Persistent usage panel.** A “⤢ Open panel” link in the tooltip (and a
  *“Open usage panel”* command) opens a dockable, **live-updating** panel with
  the full breakdown — so you can keep it open and study it, instead of relying
  on the auto-hiding hover tooltip. Clicking the status-bar item still refreshes.

## [0.2.2] — 2026-05-30

### Added

- **Easy language switching:** a “🌐 Change language / Сменить язык” link at the
  bottom of the hover tooltip, and a **“Claude Code Statusbar: Switch language”**
  command — so the language is discoverable without digging into Settings.

### Changed

- Reworded the pace verdicts for clarity and made the per-window verdict match
  the legend. EN: `on track` / `running tight` / `over pace`. RU: `в норме` /
  `близко к лимиту` / `выше нормы`.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-05-30

### Added

- Extension icon (coral tile with a usage-gauge and a green "on-track" dot).
- Screenshots (English + Russian tooltip) in the README.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-30

### Added

- **English + Russian localization** of the whole runtime UI (status bar +
  hover tooltip). New setting `ccStatusbar.language`: `auto` (follow the
  editor's display language, default), `en`, or `ru`. Command titles localized
  via `package.nls`.
- **Glossary** ("what you see", EN + RU) in the README, plus plainer
  pace-verdict wording (`on track` / `cutting it close` / `spending faster than
  the limit`; RU `в норме` / `впритык` / `опережение`).

### Changed

- README is now English-first; the Reliability section is in English.
- `fmtRemaining` and `paceLevel` take language into account (pure functions;
  unit-tested in both languages).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-30

Initial release.

### Added

- Status-bar item with a **tariff-only collapsed view**: per-window colored dot
  (🟢 в норме / 🟡 впритык / 🔴 опережение) + `5ч` / `7д` usage % + time-to-reset.
- **Real 5h / 7d subscription quota** (Claude.ai Pro/Max/Team) via Anthropic
  rate-limit response headers, throttled (≤ once per `quota.minPollSeconds`,
  default 300s) and activity-gated; can be disabled.
- **Hover tooltip** with the analytical breakdown:
  `работа (вход+выход)` + `на кэш (в эфф.)` = `эффективно`, plus cache
  read/write and estimated savings.
- `effective = work + 0.1·cache_read + 1.25·cache_write` — cache-weighted
  comparable consumption, computed from the local session transcript
  (+ subagents), matching the project's `session-cost.py`.
- Whole-item background turns yellow/red when the burn pace risks exceeding a
  window.
- Settings under `ccStatusbar.*` (refresh interval, weights, quota toggle,
  poll throttle, credentials path, alignment).
- Graceful degradation: if the quota channel fails, local metrics keep working
  and only the tariff line is hidden.

### Notes

- The 5h/7d quota uses an undocumented Anthropic channel — see README
  "Reliability". Local token/effective/cache metrics are unaffected by such
  changes.
